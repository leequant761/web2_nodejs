Alongside Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and
JavaScript (JS), it forms the triad of the World Wide Web (WWW). 
A web browser would typically receive HTML documents from either a web
server or local storage. These documents are then rendered into multimedia
web pages by the browser for viewing by a user and as such; one can say 
that these documents basically make up the structure of a web page 
semantically and originally, cues for the appearance of the document.
